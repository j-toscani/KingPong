          King Pong is a retro Pong game developed in React. ItÂ´s key features
          are crossplattform play, modern design and online multiplayer. It
          started as a single player game to learn basic JS. The first steps can
          be found

          necessary for an online-multiplayer game.

          In the beginning the focus was a fun game you could play with your
          friends. In the end, it developed into a journey into the depth of
          "you only understand it if you did it once" - land. Therefore, most my
          accomplishments can be found "under the hood". If you want to have a
          look at the code or have questions visit my git
